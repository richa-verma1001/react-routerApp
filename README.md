## About
This project demostrates a sample react application that implements React Router and works with the basic React ecosystem: Webpack, babel, node and npm.

### Dependencies
Additional dependencies outside of the ecosystem:
react-router

### Prerequisites
+ [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Npm (npm is installed with Node). [Install Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

### Description
This example can be used as a beginners React Template that gives you a starting point to run your React application without a pre-installed web server. This tutorial uses webpack as your 'dev' and 'production' server. As I learnt through this exercise, I found Webpack's dev server very useful for realtime updates to my application.

### Run Application
````
npm install
npm run production   [Run production via webpack -p]

or
npm install
npm run start  [Run devmode via webpack-dev-server]
````

Bring up browser at http://localhost:8080/ or http://localhost:8080/#/about?_k=q1l599 [this should hit the 'About' page route. See config/routes.js for more information]
